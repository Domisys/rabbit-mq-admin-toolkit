# RabbitMQ Tools

## Installation

The recommended way to install RabbitMQ Tools is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Require the
`odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit` package into your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit": "@stable"
    }
}
```

**Protip:** you should browse the
[`odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit`](https://packagist.org/packages/odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit)
page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta constraint.

## Basic Usage

You can create / update vhosts with the following command:

    ./rabbit vhost:mapping:create conf/vhost/events.yml

You can change all connection informations with options. Launch `./console
vhost:create -h` to have more informations.

You can launch the vhost creation even if the vhost already exist. Nothing will
be deleted (and it will not impact workers).

## Configuration

You can use the followings parameters for configuring an exchange:

* `with dl`: if set to true, all queues in the current vhost will be
  automatically configured to have a dl (with name: `{queueName}_dl`). Of
  course, the exchange `dl` will be created.
* `with_unroutable`: is set to true, an `unroutable` exchange will be created
  and all  others ones will be configured to move unroutable messages to this
  one. The `unroutable` exchange is a fanout exchange and a `unroutable` queue
  is bind on it.

## Example

```yaml
my_vhost_name:

    permissions:
        my_user:
            configure: amq\.gen.*
            read: .*
            write: .*
            
    parameters:
        with_dl: true # If true, all queues will have a dl and the corresponding mapping with the exchange "dl"
        with_unroutable: true # If true, all exchange will be declared with an unroutable config

    exchanges:
        my_exchange:
            type: direct
            durable: true
            with_unroutable: true #if true, unroutable exchange will be created (if not already set as global parameter)

        my_exchange_headers:
            type: headers
            durable: true

    queues:
        my_queue:
            durable: true
            delay: 5000 #create delayed message queue (value is in milliseconds)
            bindings:
                - 
                    exchange: my_exchange
                    routing_key: my_routing_key
                - 
                    exchange: my_exchange
                    routing_key: other_routing_key
                    
        another_queue:
            durable: true
            with_dl: false
            retries: [25, 125, 625]
            bindings:
                - 
                    exchange: my_exchange_headers
                    x-match: all
                    matches: {header_name: value, other_header_name: some_value}
```

## Federation

Complex configuration could also be managed with the following convention:

### Federation configuration files
In your configuration folder you'll need at least 3 configuration files.

Global configuration file list the rabbit mq hosts, the users to create on each instance of rabbitmq, and the federation strategy.
global.yml
```yaml
locations: #List of clusters location
    locationA:
      - host-rabbitmq1
      - host-rabbitmq2
    locationB:
      - host-rabbitmq3

federation:
    enabled: true
    strategy: full
    upstream: #federation-upstream component configuration
        expires: 36000000
        ack-mode: on-confirm

admin:
    login: guest
    password: guest

users:
    - {login: userA, password: notASecuredPassword}
    - {login: userB, password: notASecuredPasswordToo}
    -
      login: johnDoe
      password: johnPassword
      tags: monitoring
      overwrite: false # true if you want to overwrite the password and tags existing definition. Permissions will always be overwriten.
      permissions: # you can override default user permissions as well
          configure: .*
          read: .*
          write: .*

defaultPermissions:
    configure: amq\.gen.*
    read: .*
    write: .*
```

Shared configuration file will contain vhosts, exchanges, queues, policies to create in each clusters. It respect the basic yaml configuration file
shared.yml 
```yaml
aVhost:
    parameters:
        with_dl: true # If true, all queues will have a dl and the corresponding mapping with the exchange "dl"
        with_unroutable: true # If true, all exchange will be declared with an unroutable config

    exchanges:
        #exchangeNodeName:
        #    type: direct #direct, fanout, headers, topic
        #    durable: true #if true, exchange will be re-created on rabbit crash or reboot (doesn't persist messages)
        #    with_unroutable: true #if true, unroutable exchange will be created (if not set as global parameter)

    queues:
        #queueName:
        #    durable: true #if true, queue will be re-created on rabbit crash or reboot (doesn't persist messages)
        #    retries: [25, 125, 625] #create as many queue as retry values (values are seconds)
        #    delay: 5000 #create delayed queue (value is in milliseconds)
        #    bindings: 
        #        - 
        #            exchange: exchangeNodeName
        #            routing_key: the.routing.key.value
        
    policies:
        #policyName:
        #    pattern: ^amq. #regex
        #    definition: {key: val} #full list in administration interface
        #    priority: 0 #optionnal
        #    apply-to: all #exchanges, queues or all 
```

Then you'll need as many configuration files as you've locations in your global.yml definition.
 * locationA.yml
 * locationB.yml
All exchanges, queues specified here are configured in rabbitmq hosts that are defined in locations.

### Federation command

In order to apply federation configuration you've the following command:

    ./rabbit federation:configuration:create configFolder

As the basic configuration, nothing will be deleted and you've the --dry-run optionnal argument to control that you're configuration is valid.

## Changelog

### BC breaks between 1.x and 2.0.x

  * Short binding syntax is no more supported. 
```yaml
  # old syntax
  queues:
    my_queue:
        bindings:
            - my_exchange:my_routing_key
```
must be replaced by
```yaml
  # new syntax
  queues:
    my_queue:
        bindings:
            - 
                exchange: my_exchange
                routing_key: my_routing_key
```
